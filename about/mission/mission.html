            <p>4th Family Incorporated is a not-for-profit organization that hosts teen/community events, mentor programs, personal development programs, educational programming, wellness & health programs, annual sport leagues & tournaments, as well as educational trips. We engage all communities within the Capital District, starting in the high schools.

 <div id="history">
            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>4th Family Incorporated is a grassroots not-for-profit organization that was founded in 2011 by two young men who returned to the Capital Region after college graduation. The slogan of 4th Family is “it takes a community” and that simple statement has been the guiding principle of the organization since its founding.  Our mission is to assist, empower, and educate those in the community who strive for success. Our vision is a society that exudes integrity, encourages education, produces leaders, and fosters growth for the ascension of the individual and the community as a whole.  </p>

 </div>
  <div id="goals">
            <h1>Goals</h1>
            <p>We have identified three endemic issues in our Capital Region urban communities to address to effect a positive change in our communities. They are as follows:</p>
			<li class="issue">the lack of concern with youth development in urban communities</li>
			<li class="issue">the need for drastic improvements in youth education to enable better youth outcomes</li>
			<li class="issue">accountability within our communities from all groups and members. </li>
			
			<p>To address each of these issues we have developed novel youth and community programs that connect underserved populations to resources in the Capital Region that have previously seemed incredibly disparate. </p>
