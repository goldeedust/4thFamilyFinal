                    <p>Many words flood my mind and produce thoughts that will entice many ingenious but radical ideas as to how I will do business to help people. As we embark on this journey to uplift communities, inspire families, and develop hope and passion, we at 4th Family, believe that you will be an asset to our organization in all the many facets that we operate in.</p>
                    <p>Born in Albany New York, I grew up in the South End, spending much of my childhood at my grandparent’s house, which sits on the corner of Broad and 3rd Street. Throughout the years, I have had first-hand experience of drugs, crime, gangs, youth pregnancy, and domestic abuse. Growing up in such an environment, it is near impossible to succeed without positive role models to follow or outlets to learn, develop, and grow in. My outlet was sports. I kept busy in the winter with bowling, spring and summer with baseball and basketball, and fall with football. As a teen, I enjoyed the Teen Centers at Hoffman Park, Hackett Middle school, and the YMCA, these places no longer exist or do not operate in the same capacity. Later on, I then barely graduated from Albany High School with a “C” average.</p>
                    <p>I then attended Mount Ida College where I began to take education serious and realized my potential. After obtaining a 3.93 GPA, I then transferred to Morehouse College in Atlanta, GA, where I gained extensive knowledge, experiences, and most importantly the passion to help people. I was apart and started organizations while in attendance. I tutored and mentored many younger students, but my heart was in Albany and knew I could not give 100% to another city when knowing that my hometown was in crisis and needed help just as anywhere else. After my four years at Morehouse College, I graduated Cum Laude along with a position at KeyBank as a Management Associate in Albany.</p>
                    <p>With all roads to victory, I knew it was time to make a difference in my community. Stemming from a Social Entrepreneurship class I much enjoyed at Morehouse College, I birthed an idea that would radically change the social environment in my community, and then bring it to others in Upstate New York, and eventually spread throughout the nation. After partnering with my old middle school classmate (John Scott) we have been working diligently to see our Vision come to fruition.</p>
                    <p>It will be a pleasure to have you join us on this journey to change the world! I look forward to seeing you hand-in-hand with us at the finish line….“It Takes a Community”!</p>
